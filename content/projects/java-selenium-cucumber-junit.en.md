In [this project](https://github.com/jesusfj710/java-selenium-cucumber-junit/) a proof of concept of a web testing framework has been developed with the following technologies:
- Java
- Selenium
- Cucumber
- Junit

Maven has also been used for the management of the libraries.

There is a feature file containing the test scenarios and several step files depending on the functionality you want to test.

You can check the `README.md` of the project to see how to run it on your computer, although it is likely that the locators of the Amazon interface elements have changed since this post was written.
