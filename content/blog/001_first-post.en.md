> ⚠️ **Update 04/24/2023** ⚠️: After checking that the charlola theme was actually (without having correctly attributed it) a fork of `hugo-PaperMod` I decided to change it and update the repository license.

After a long time, I have finally decided to make a website where I can have my own portfolio (in the future) as well as uploading some articles about things I find interesting.

The aim is no other than forcing myself to document and explain how I do things and thus be able to share everything.

## Building the web

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which uses [Go](http://go.dev) *aka Golang* underneath.

It's super convenient to be able to write things directly in *markdown*, upload them to your Github repository, have a Github *workflow* do the *build* of the site and publish it directly in less than a minute.

You can take a look at the progress of the project in the [github repository](https://github.com/jesusfj710/jesusfj710.github.io).

A big thanks to [charlola](https://www.heycharlola.com/) for his template and instructions on the Hugo theme.

### Features of the website

* Home page with link to my LinkedIn and Github
* Blog
* Contact page

It will also be available in three languages:

* Spanish
* English
* Korean (although the blog will only be in English and Spanish)
