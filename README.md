This repo contains my Hugo-built website showcasing my web development skills. It's responsive, modern, and easy to navigate.

# Installation

To install Hugo, follow the official installation guide.

# Adding a Theme

To add a theme to your website, download the theme from the Hugo theme directory or a third-party source and extract it to the themes/ directory in your Hugo project. Then, specify the theme in the config.toml file in the root directory of your project.

# Automating the Build and Deployment Process

To automate the process of building and deploying your Hugo site to GitHub Pages, you can use the workflow in `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`.
